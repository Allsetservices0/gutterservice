          The Ultimate Property Maintenance Checklist for Every Homeowner</h1>
          <p>When it comes to keeping your home or business in top condition, property maintenance is more than just a checklist — it’s the key to protecting your investment and ensuring long-term comfort and safety. Whether you own a family home, <a href="https://allsetpropertyservices.co.uk/">manage rental properties</a>
or run commercial premises, staying on top of regular maintenance can save you from expensive repairs later on.

          </p>
          <h3>What Is Property Maintenance?</h3>
          <p>Property maintenance refers to the continuous care and repair of buildings, structures, and outdoor spaces. It covers everything from roof cleaning and repairs to gutter cleaning & repairs, fencing, and much more. Neglecting small issues — like a loose fence post or blocked gutter — can lead to costly structural damage over time.
